# RecipeClub

**Milestone 2 project for Code institute Software Development Programme.** 

## User Experience (UX)
### Strategy 
The aim of this project is to create an online cookbook where users can create and share their recipes with fellow users. 

#### User Stories
**As a user I would like to**
1. Be able to register to the website
- There is a call to action button for registeration on the index page 
2. Be able to log in/log out
- Log in button is available on the navbar for all users at the home page and the log out button only available to logged in users. 
3. Be able to Create, Update and Delete recipes
- Users can easily create recipes by following link presented on the navbar. Once a user selects a one of there own recipes they will be presented with both and edit and delete button.
4. Be able to share recipes while keeping some private
- While creating a recipe users can select whether they want to keep the recipe private or not.
5. Be able to browse and search all public recipes
- In the navbar users can easily navigate to all recipes and select what recipe they'd like to view.

**As the site Admin I would like to**
1. Post recipe of the month on the Home page
- In the navbar only visible to the admin there, they can click the 'winner' link to where they can then select which recipe has won. The recipe is automatically shown on the index page.
2. Maintain functionality and avoid unlawful access to restricted content i.e. other users data
- While users can edit and delete their own recipes. These privilidges are also awarded to the admin so they can make sure approproiate content is posted.
